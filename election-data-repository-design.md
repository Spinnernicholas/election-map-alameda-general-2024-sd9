# GitHub Election Data Repository Design

This document defines a GitHub-hosted repository format for election datasets that this app can consume.

## Goals
- Publish election datasets as static JSON and GeoJSON files.
- Provide one machine-readable index that lists all elections.
- Support direct hosting with GitHub Pages and no backend.
- Keep each election self-contained and easy to version.
- Allow flexible folder structure and file naming.

## Repository Structure

/elections.index.json
/elections/
  /2026-11-03-general/
    election.json
    precincts.gis.json
    metadata.json

Optional deeper organization if needed:
 /elections/
  /2026-11-03-general/
    /ca/
      /contra-costa/
        election.json
        precincts.gis.json
        metadata.json

Recommended election folder name format:
- yyyy-mm-dd-type
- type can be primary, general, special

Examples:
- 2026-11-03-general
- 2026-06-02-primary
- 2026-08-18-special

The election id in elections.index.json can follow this same pattern, but it is not required for app compatibility.

Previous county-first layout is fully supported.

/legacy-example/
/elections/
  /ca/
    /contra-costa/
      /2026-11-03-supervisor-d2/
        election.json
        precincts.gis.json
        metadata.json

## Index Contract

Top-level file: elections.index.json

Required top-level fields:
- version: integer schema version
- updated: ISO date string
- elections: array of election entries

Optional top-level fields:
- defaultElectionId: id to auto-load by default

Election entry fields:
- id: unique stable ID (any string)
- label: display name used by the app
- date: election date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- type: optional metadata (for example primary, general, special)
- county: county name
- state: state abbreviation
- dataUrl: relative path or absolute URL to election results JSON
- precinctsUrl: relative path or absolute URL to precinct GeoJSON
- precinctIdField: property name in GeoJSON that maps to election precinct keys
- precinctLabelField: property name used for popup titles
- grouped: boolean used by app behavior

Recommended optional fields:
- source.name
- source.url
- tags array
- description

## Hosting Pattern

Use GitHub Pages from main branch root.

Example base URL:
https://YOUR_ORG.github.io/election-data-repo/

Example index URL:
https://YOUR_ORG.github.io/election-data-repo/elections.index.json

The app should read the index URL, pick defaultElectionId when present, and load dataUrl and precinctsUrl from the selected entry.

Path resolution rules:
- Relative paths are resolved relative to the index file location.
- Absolute URLs are used as-is, so data can live in another repository or domain.

## App Integration Pattern

This app now supports reading:
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cocoa-County/ElectionOpenDataRepository/main/elections.index.json

Behavior:
- App loads an external index URL and selects defaultElectionId or first entry.
- App applies mapped fields and file URLs from selected entry.
- Relative and absolute URLs are both supported in index entries.
- If index or data files fail to load, app remains usable and renders an empty map state.

## Validation Checklist
- Every election.id is unique.
- defaultElectionId exists in elections array.
- dataUrl and precinctsUrl resolve successfully from the index file context.
- GeoJSON feature properties contain precinctIdField.
- election.json precinct keys match precinctIdField values.

## Minimal Example Index

{
  "version": 1,
  "updated": "2026-05-31",
  "defaultElectionId": "2026-11-03-general",
  "elections": [
    {
      "id": "2026-11-03-general",
      "type": "general",
      "label": "Contra Costa Mock - Supreme Snack Commissioner",
      "date": "2026-11-03",
      "county": "Contra Costa",
      "state": "CA",
      "dataUrl": "elections/2026-11-03-general/election.json",
      "precinctsUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_ORG/another-repo/main/elections/2026-11-03-general/precincts.gis.json",
      "precinctIdField": "PrecinctID",
      "precinctLabelField": "PrecinctNM",
      "grouped": false
    }
  ]
}
